# Are you thinking about your product metrics wrong?

More often than not, when you are not able to deliver growth or achieve goals is because you have been thinking about your product metrics completely wrong. Read on to find out if you are and how to fix them.

## Top 4 symptoms:

If you have defined your metrics based on one or more of the following:

1. Reports your analytics tool generates out of the box
2. None of the other stakeholders of your product were involved in setting them up
3. Your metrics are from a recent blog post you read (cough cough! the irony :P)
4. Daily Active Users(DAUs) and Monthly Active Users (MAUs) are your top metrics

Yes? You should read on.

## Don't panic! We can fix it. 

Before we get into fixing the issue, it is important that you develop the right thinking frame around your metrics and understand how to think about them.

### Why look at metrics atall? -- a mental modal:

Think of the product as the engine of the car. Reporting on Daily Active Users (DAUs) and Monthly Active Users (MAUs) is like looking at how fast the wheels are spinning to determine how good your engine is. 

But wait, isn't that what we do? Yes, but that is not the whole picture. Looking at how fast the wheels are running now does not tell you for how much longer the engine might run, how much fuel it is consuming, or if it will deliver the same speed when the car is max-loaded, or on a slope. To figure out all the other parameters, we have engine temperature indicators, oil change indicators, fuel guages and much more. 

Similarly, products are fundamentally built to help users get a job done. [Jobs to be done](link) frame of thinking, but unlike a car, each one needs its own set of guages that will indicate how the health of the product is.

DAUs and MAUs gives you no visibiltiy on what is happening on the product when the user is using or more importantly, why the user is **not** using it. Sometimes even the true value of the product might be elsewhere in a feature you almost paid no attention to. 

Like the engine, it is important to understand what the context is -- what type of load is it expected to bear, for how long should it run or how much fuel is it going to burn in doing that. 

Metrics you choose should tell you:
1. if your product is succeding in helping your user get the job done
2. if you are moving towards the business goals
3. by what measure of success/failure is it doing that 
4. indicate future success or failure.


> Any metric that is not actioned on atleast on a weekly basis is a mertic that has started to decay.


### Framework for  defining metrics:

**Note:** The first time you go through defining these, you should involve leadership and representation from other departments. What you find might shock you and might even create unease in reporting them. It is important that you stay the course and followthrough on the metrics, because if they have defined them right, your path ahead will be much simpler.


- **The North star metric:**
This is the link between a(sometimes even ‚Äúthe‚Äù) **user problem, the product effort** and the **business goals.** A north star is meant to give clarity on the following:


  - Alignment on what to optimise for and how to prioritise üéØ 
  - 50,000 ft. view of success and impact of initiatives üòé 
  - Establish (drum roll‚Ä¶) accountability üò∞ 

  Having the right north star is of paramount importance as choosing the wrong one can lead to a lot of wasted time and effort. It should be a simple metric that best captures the goals. 
  **Note:** the north star can change but only when there is a big strategy change or maybe across years.
  A couple of examples would be :

  1. **Facebook** ‚Äî Success ‚Äî they figured out early on that their north star would be to get every user signing up to add at-least 7 other people as friends on the platform. From then on, the platform itself would take care of the engagement through social interactions and notifications
  2. **LinkedIn** ‚Äî Failure ‚Äî Back in 2012, Linkedin set **Endorsement** as their north star (what endorsement? yes that‚Äôs also what I thought). This lead them to wrong priorities and

- **Leading Indicators**
This is one of the metrics that is used to indicate future business outcomes. They could be north star metrics, but not necessarily. Revenue and ARPU etc. are ***lagging indicators*** as these are metrics that are reported post to the event happening. 

- **KPI(s) (Key Performance Indicator):**
**Measurable** **value(s**) that demonstrates how well the objective is being achieved. These should be chosen carefully to be able to reflect the progress towards/away from the goals of the company. Care should be taken to make sure that KPIs cover different dimensions of the north star metric. 
There could also be a set of metrics for

- **OKR(s) (Objectives and Key Results):**
This is nothing to do with the product per se, (but it may). Usually is a framework for defining and tracking people, teams and organisations. Product analytics does not as much depend on the OKRs, but different teams may have different approaches to the same. 



Most often, there are multiple stakeholders interested in different perspectives of you product that you must be accounting for. For instance, marketing is interested in where conversions are coming form, your CXO would be interested in revenue/business health and goals, product and design would be interested in critical paths, conversions, and a lot more.
